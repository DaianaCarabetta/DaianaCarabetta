### Hi there 👋

🙂I am a Full Stack Developer with practical experience in various projects using technologies such as ✔️ReactJS, NodeJS and PostgreSQL, among others.

For 10 years, I have stood out in the field of Veterinary Medicine, working for different companies, serving as a teacher at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and finally as a veterinarian for the Argentine Army.

🚀I am characterized by being enthusiastic, persevering, highly responsible and dedicated, with a clear focus on continuous learning and achieving new goals. My goal is to provide knowledge to the work team, promoting camaraderie and a positive work environment.

🌍I have a certified level of English B2 and I continue to perfect myself, as it is essential for communication.

If you consider that I can add value to your project or team, do not hesitate to contact me through 📩dai_dvc@hotmail.com.
I will be happy to collaborate.
